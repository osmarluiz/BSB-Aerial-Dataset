This repository shows an example on how to use Detectron2's Panoptic-FPN in the BSB Aerial Dataset.

The dataset will be publicly available very shortly. For now, if you wish to download the data, please email me at osmarcarvalho@ieee.org.

The dataset is structured following the COCO annotation format recommendations.
